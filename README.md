## üîß Technical Details

### Smart Contract Functions

```rust
// Record investment in artwork
pub fn invest(env: Env, artwork_id: Bytes, investor: Address, amount: u32)

// Get total investment amount
pub fn get_total_invested(env: Env, artwork_id: Bytes) -> u32

// Get last investor address
pub fn get_last_investor(env: Env, artwork_id: Bytes) -> Option<Address>

// Check if artwork is fully funded
pub fn is_fully_funded(env: Env, artwork_id: Bytes) -> bool
```

### Frontend API Integration

```typescript
// Investment management
class ContractManager {
  async investInArtwork(artworkId: string, amount: number): Promise<string>
  async getUserInvestments(userAddress: string): Promise<Investment[]>
  async getUserPurchases(userAddress: string): Promise<Purchase[]>
}

// Wallet connectivity
class WalletManager {
  async connectWallet(): Promise<WalletState>
  async signTransaction(xdr: string): Promise<string>
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Environment Setup

1. **Install Stellar CLI**

## üö® Disclaimer

This is a testnet demonstration project. Do not use real funds. All transactions are performed on Stellar testnet with test XLM tokens.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Transaction Issues

**Transaction Timeout Errors:**
- **Problem**: "Transaction timeout" or "txTooLate" errors
- **Solution**: The application now automatically retries failed transactions. If the issue persists, wait 10-30 seconds and try again.

**Insufficient Balance:**
- **Problem**: "Insufficient balance" error
- **Solution**: Ensure your testnet account has enough XLM for the transaction plus fees (minimum 0.1 XLM extra for fees).

**Account Not Found:**
- **Problem**: "Account not found" error  
- **Solution**: Your testnet account needs to be funded. Get test XLM from the Stellar testnet faucet.

**Wallet Connection Issues:**
- **Problem**: "Wallet not connected" error
- **Solution**: Ensure Freighter extension is installed and connected to the Stellar testnet.

### Getting Test XLM

1. Install Freighter wallet extension
2. Switch to "Testnet" network in Freighter
3. Copy your testnet public key
4. Visit [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator) to fund your account
5. Or use the Stellar CLI: `stellar keys fund your-key --network testnet`

### Performance Tips

- **Network Busy**: If transactions are slow, the testnet might be busy. The application will automatically retry.
- **Multiple Investments**: Wait for each transaction to complete before starting the next one.
- **Browser Issues**: Clear browser cache if you experience persistent wallet connection issues.
